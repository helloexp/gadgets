# UNIQLO Design Patterns
## Collecting reusable code and tools to streamline development

### Contents of this Repo

**bashScripts** holds command line tools I use regularly. The only one there now allows me to launch the iOS Emulator from the command line.

**gulpinjector** contains the code and its instructions on using the [Yeoman](https://yeoman.io/) generator when scaffolding my dev environment for projects. What's there works, but needs to be streamlined by creating a custom generator. Feel free to do that yourself if you're feeling ambitious.

### Miscelaneous Apps Used Regularly
#### macOS Tools
[Go2Shell](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/go2shell/id445770608?mt=12) is an app that launches a terminal window directly from a finder window. It presents a new button in the Finder toolbar allowing a single click to open.

[ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/mac) heavily compresses images. via Dina
