### Contents of this Repo

**constantAspectRatio**: a snippet that allows one to embed a bit of content (esp a video) who's aspect ratio need to be maintained. There are a couple options in there for common aspect ratios.

**bashScripts**: command line tools I use regularly. The only one there now allows me to launch the iOS Emulator from the command line.

### Miscelaneous Apps Used Regularly
#### macOS Tools
[Go2Shell](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/go2shell/id445770608?mt=12) is an app that launches a terminal window directly from a finder window. It presents a new button in the Finder toolbar allowing a single click to open.

[ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/mac) heavily compresses images. via Dina
